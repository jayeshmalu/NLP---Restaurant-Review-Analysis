# NLP-Restaurant Review(Sentiment) Analysis

## Problem Statement : Analysis of sentiment from customers review

## Dataset : 1,000 data points

### Solution:
#### Analysis of reviews can help business people to improve their business by analyzing sentiments from the customer reviews i.e positive or negative about products. So this engine will extract sentiment from customer reviews using Natural Language Processing & Deep Learning
#### In this project I used NLP (nltk library) for text cleaning and to convert words into vectors.
#### Then I applied Machine Learning algorithm i.e Naive Bayes algorithm which is based on conditional probability but I got less accuracy of 69%. 
#### So, to improve accuarcy I used Deep Learning algorithm i.e Artificial Neural Network and I got 74% accuracy
