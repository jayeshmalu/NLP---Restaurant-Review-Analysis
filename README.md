# NLP-Restaurant Review(Sentiment) Analysis

### Problem Statement : Analysis of sentiment from customers review

## Solution :
#### Analysis of reviews can help business people to improve their business by analyzing sentiments from the customer reviews i.e positive or negative about the products. So I have built an AI/ML-Based Model that can extract sentiment from customer reviews using Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning & Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Dataset : 1,000 data points

#### Model Building :
In this project I used NLP (nltk library) for text cleaning and to convert words into vectors.

Then I applied Machine Learning algorithm i.e Naive Bayes algorithm which is based on conditional probability but I got less accuracy of 69%. 

So, to improve accuarcy I used Deep Learning algorithm i.e Artificial Neural Network and I got 74% accuracy
